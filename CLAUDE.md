# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a **Claude Code + Codex CLI plugin marketplace** — a collection of plugins (skills, slash commands, hooks) that users install into Claude Code via the `/plugin` command, or into Codex CLI via `codex --install`.

There is no build system, no tests, and no dependencies. The repo is pure Markdown and JSON.

## Repository Structure

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   ← Claude Code registry of all plugins
.codex-plugin/marketplace.json    ← Codex CLI registry with policy/category fields
.codex-plugin/hooks.json          ← SessionStart hook config (git pull on startup)
INSTALL.md                        ← Codex self-installer (give to a Codex agent to run)
plugins/<name>/                   ← Each plugin lives in its own directory
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json      ← Claude Code manifest (name, description, version)
  .codex-plugin/plugin.json       ← Codex CLI manifest (same fields + "skills": "./skills/")
  skills/<skill>/SKILL.md         ← Skill definitions (frontmatter + instructions, shared by both)
  README.md                       ← Plugin documentation
```

## How to Add a New Plugin

1. Create `plugins/<name>/`
2. Add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with `name`, `description`, and `version`
3. Add `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with the same fields plus `"skills": "./skills/"`
4. Add skills under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
5. Add a `README.md` for the plugin
6. Run `/sync-docs` to propagate the new plugin into both marketplace files, `INSTALL.md`, `UNINSTALL.md`, and `docs/index.html`. (Doing it by hand also works — `/sync-docs` just automates it.)
7. Run `python3 scripts/validate.py` to confirm everything stayed consistent. The pre-commit hook and CI run the same check.

## Validation and maintenance

`scripts/validate.py` is the source of truth for "is the marketplace internally consistent." It runs on every push and PR via `.github/workflows/validate.yml`, and locally via `.githooks/pre-commit`.

Enable the pre-commit hook once per clone:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The validator checks:
- Both marketplace JSON files parse and contain every `plugins/<name>/` directory
- Every `plugins/<name>/` has both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with matching `name` fields
- Every `SKILL.md` has parseable frontmatter with `name` matching its directory
- Every user-facing plugin and skill (everything except `maintenance`) appears in `INSTALL.md`, `UNINSTALL.md`, and `docs/index.html`

Pure stdlib Python 3.9+ — no install step.

## SKILL.md Format

Skill files use YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown instructions:

- `name` — skill name (used as the slash command)
- `description` — one-line description
- `argument-hint` — placeholder shown to the user (e.g., `"[commit message]"`)
- `disable-model-invocation` — set `true` for tool-only skills
- `allowed-tools` — comma-separated list of tools the skill can use (e.g., `Bash`)

The Markdown body defines the skill's behavior: process steps, rules, and constraints.
