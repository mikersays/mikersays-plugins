# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This is a **Claude Code + Codex CLI plugin marketplace** — a collection of plugins (skills, slash commands, hooks) that users install into Claude Code via the `/plugin` command, or into Codex CLI via `codex plugin marketplace add`.

There is no build system, no tests, and no dependencies. The repo is pure Markdown, JSON, and YAML.

## Repository Structure

```
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json  ← Codex CLI registry (canonical path)
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   ← Claude Code registry of all plugins
.codex-plugin/marketplace.json    ← Codex CLI registry (legacy fallback)
.codex-plugin/hooks.json          ← SessionStart hook config (git pull on startup)
CLAUDE.md                         ← Claude Code project instructions
AGENTS.md                         ← Codex CLI project instructions
INSTALL.md                        ← Codex self-installer (give to a Codex agent to run)
plugins/<name>/                   ← Each plugin lives in its own directory
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json      ← Claude Code manifest (name, description, version)
  .codex-plugin/plugin.json       ← Codex CLI manifest (same fields + skills, interface)
  skills/<skill>/SKILL.md         ← Skill definitions (frontmatter + instructions, shared by both)
  skills/<skill>/agents/openai.yaml ← Codex skill UI metadata (optional)
  README.md                       ← Plugin documentation
```

## How to Add a New Plugin

1. Create `plugins/<name>/`
2. Add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with `name`, `description`, and `version`
3. Add `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with the same fields plus `"skills": "./skills/"` and an `interface` object (`displayName`, `shortDescription`, `category`)
4. Add skills under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
5. Optionally add `skills/<skill-name>/agents/openai.yaml` for Codex UI metadata
6. Add a `README.md` for the plugin
7. Run `/sync-docs` to propagate the new plugin into all three marketplace files, `INSTALL.md`, `UNINSTALL.md`, and `docs/index.html`. (Doing it by hand also works — `/sync-docs` just automates it.)
8. Run `python3 scripts/validate.py` to confirm everything stayed consistent. The pre-commit hook and CI run the same check.

## Validation and maintenance

`scripts/validate.py` is the source of truth for "is the marketplace internally consistent." It runs on every push and PR via `.github/workflows/validate.yml`, and locally via `.githooks/pre-commit`.

Enable the pre-commit hook once per clone:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The validator checks:
- All three marketplace JSON files parse and contain every `plugins/<name>/` directory
- Both `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` exist at the repo root
- Every `plugins/<name>/` has both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with matching `name` fields
- Every `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` has an `interface` object
- Every `SKILL.md` has parseable frontmatter with `name` matching its directory
- Every `agents/openai.yaml` (if present) has an `interface:` key and is non-empty
- Every user-facing plugin and skill (everything except `maintenance`) appears in `INSTALL.md`, `UNINSTALL.md`, and `docs/index.html`

Pure stdlib Python 3.9+ — no install step.

## SKILL.md Format

Skill files use YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown instructions:

- `name` — skill name (used as the slash command)
- `description` — one-line description (also used for implicit skill matching in Codex)

Claude Code also recognizes these optional fields (ignored by Codex):
- `argument-hint` — placeholder shown to the user (e.g., `"[commit message]"`)
- `disable-model-invocation` — set `true` for tool-only skills
- `allowed-tools` — comma-separated list of tools the skill can use (e.g., `Bash`)

The Markdown body defines the skill's behavior: process steps, rules, and constraints.

## agents/openai.yaml Format

Optional per-skill Codex UI metadata. Lives at `skills/<skill>/agents/openai.yaml`:

```yaml
interface:
  display_name: Human Readable Name
  short_description: One-line description for Codex UI
policy:
  allow_implicit_invocation: true   # false for init/setup skills
```
